Performs L U decomposition on given square matrix with partial pivoting
-
Input:
A = coefficient matrix
Outputs:
L = lower triangular matrix 
U = upper triangular matrix 
P = pivot matrix
-
Input a square matrix.
Code will perform L U decomposition with pivoting and will output the lower triangular matrix, upper triangular matrix, 
and pivoting matrix (which tracks which rows were pivoted)
In the end the initial matrix multiplied by the P matrix should equal the L matrix multiplied by the U matrix
