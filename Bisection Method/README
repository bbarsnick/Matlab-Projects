# Bisection Method
Function that implements the bisection method to find the roots of a function to an inputted error
-
Inputs:
func - function being evaluated
xl - lower guess
xu - upper guess
es - desired relative error (default = 0.0001%)
maxit - maximum allowable iterations (default = 50)
Outputs:
root - real root
fx - function value at root
ea - approximate relative arror
iter - number of iterations
-
Enter the function you are taking the roots of and an upper and lower guess that brackets the root. Additional options are to 
enter your desired error and maximum iterations.
This will output the root estimate and function value at the roots estimated value, also the error and number of iterations used
