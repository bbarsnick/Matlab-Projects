This function models the false position method which is used to estimate the roots of a given function
-
Inputs:
func - the function being evaluated
xl - the lower guess
xu - the upper guess
es - the desired relative error (default = 0.0001%)
maxiter - the number of iterations desired (default = 200)
Outputs:
root - the estimated root location
fx - the function evaluated at the root location
ea - the approximate relative error 
iter - how many iterations were performed
-
Input the function being evaluated along with an upper and lower bound guess that bracket the root and if wanted the desired
error and maximum iterations.
The estimated root location, function value at that location, error and number of iterations will be outputted.
