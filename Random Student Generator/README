Developed a code to randomly call on a set of inputted students and change the probability they will be called on again 
depending on if they are present or not.
-
First set up the class by using the "set up class" code. With this you can input all of the classmates names as a cell array
and name it "names2"
Then change the name of the course to whatever you would like (right now it is Mech105)
Then correct the save path to desired settings
-
Once the class is set up and saved you can now use the callstudent function simpy by inputting the previously set course name 
choosen while setting up the cass. You can aso input how many students you would like to call on with each call (default is one)
Then after running the function it will display a randomly choosen student and ask if the student is here with 1 as yes 
and 2 as no and any other button as skip. 
If the student was here their probability of being called again will be lowered, if they were not present their probability of
being called on again will increase, and if skipped their probability remains the same.
